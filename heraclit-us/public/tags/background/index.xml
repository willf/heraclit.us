      <description>Not much is actually known about Heraclitus. Here&amp;rsquo;s what historians think they know.
Heraclitus was an early Greek philosopher. He came from the Greek city of Ephesus, in Asia Minor area known as Ionia, populated by Greek-speaking people, but under the control of the Persian empire of the time. There is a myth or legend or story that he was at least an honorary king of Ionia, but there is not much evidence of that.</description>
